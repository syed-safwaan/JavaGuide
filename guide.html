    <h1>Complete Java Install/Run Guide + Editor Choices</h1>
    <h6>By Syed Safwaan, Minister of Pythonic Affairs 2017-2018</h6>

    <p>
        In this guide, we'll be comprehensively going over how to install
        <b>Java and an editor (multiple options shown).</b>
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Introduction
        <small>
            <i>(skip at your own peril)</i>
        </small>
    </h2>

    <h3>Brief Overview of Language</h3>
    <p>
        Java is a high-level compiled, object-oriented (OOP) language. It's very popular
        in the field of software development, and is a commonly used language in
        applications ranging from games to business tools. For a beginner, Java may
        be intimidating to deal with. However, with time and use, it quickly becomes
        natural and perhaps a favourite language as well, once its merits are realized.
    </p>

    <h3>Differences from Python</h3>
    <p>
        As stated above, Java is a
        <i>compiled language</i>. This is very different from Python, which is an
        <i>interpreted language</i>.
        <i>Interpreted</i> means that a program on your computer goes through your code
        <b>line-by-line</b> and executes each on the computer. It's a friendlier type
        of language, evident by the existence of Python Shell and IDLE, where you
        can both run code line by line (shell) and save programs (IDLE).
        <br>
        <br> However,
        <i>compiled</i> means that
        <b>at startup</b>, all the code is compressed into a readable format when you
        hit "run." Then, the code is all executed "at once," resulting in very fast
        programs. However, because of its compiled nature, there is no Java Shell
        (until
        <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/jshell/introduction-jshell.htm">Java 9</a>, that is). Java doesn't come with an IDLE either; it only has
        the libraries and the compiler when installed. This makes installing and
        running Java programs much more unintuitive for beginners coming from Python.
    </p>

    <h3>Purpose of This Guide</h3>
    <p>
        Installing Java is very different from installing Python. Sure, you can use
        <a target="_blank" href="https://repl.it/">repl.it</a> or some other online editor to write your code and avoid the
        hassles, but installing Java on your computer is certain to get you the best
        programming environment. With ICS4U approaching soon, it's imperative that
        we all get in some good Java XP before we enter, as Gr 12 CS is much more
        difficult than Gr 11, and best if not BSed :).
        <small>*cough*</small>
        <br>
        <br> With that out, I think it's safe to say that it's in all of your best interests
        to give Java at least a quick whirl before the school year.
    </p>

    <h3>Intended Audience</h3>
    <p>
        This guide is intended for
        <b>inexperienced users</b> who aren't sure how to configure Java correctly and
        would like some assistance. If you have more than rudimentary knowledge on
        how to install tools for a language and configure an editor, this guide will
        likely bore you.
        <br>
        <br> While this guide uses Windows 10 to demonstrate the procedure, a user of
        any OS can follow along and perform the same steps with minor modifications.

    <h2>PART 1 - INSTALLING JAVA</h2>
    <h5>
        <i>
            We are using Java 8 for this guide. If you wish to use a newer version, note the
            differences between your screen and my crops and decide accordingly.
        </i>
    </h5>

    <p>
        Installing Java is really just installing the libraries and the compiler. These things
        are put into a package called a
        <b>JDK</b>, or
        <b>Java Development Kit</b>.
    </p>

    <b>
        <i>
            A. Go to the
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html">Java JDK download page</a>
            and select a JDK for your computer
        </i>
    </b>
    <p>
        In the first link selection article, click "Accept License Agreement" and click the
        link that corresponds with your system (Windows x86 and Windows x64)*.
    </p>
    <h5>
        <i>
            This depends on the bits and your operating system. To check the number of bits on
            your system, just navigate to My Computer, right click, select Properties
            and you should see your bitsize.
        </i>
    </h5>
    <h5>
        <i>
            * - Newer versions of Java only offer 64-bit downloads. If you're using an older
            32-bit system, downgrade your Java version.

                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </center>

    <b>
        <i>B. Run the downloaded executable</i>
    </b>
    <p>
        This step is simple enough. Just run the installer and say OK to all the settings.
        If you are confident and want to tamper with a few install settings, do so
        at your own peril.
        <b>Remember the directory you save Java to.</b>

        </p>
    </center>
    <p>
        With that, Java is now on your system! It's still unusable (for normies) because
        we don't have an editor (smh normies), but it's now on your computer.
    </p>

    <h2>PART 2 - INSTALLING AND USING EDITOR (JCreator)</h2>
    <b>
        <i>X. Preface</i>
    </b>
    <p>
        JCreator is a light
        <b>IDE</b>, which stands for
        <b>I</b>ntegrated
        <b>D</b>evelopment
        <b>E</b>nvironment. Because Java doesn't have an IDLE or a shell like Python
        does when installed, we will use JCreator when developing applications (or
        normal programs, for normies).

    </p>
    <b>
        <i>A. Run the executable to install JCreator</i>
    </b>
    <p>
        The installation of JCreator is as simple as the installation of Java. Verfiy everything
        as usual and follow the cues in the images shown.

    </center>
    <b>
        <i>B. Set up general runtime settings on JCreator boot</i>
    </b>
    <p>
        JCreator should boot immediately after finishing the installation. On boot, it will
        ask for more configurations relating to the way you want Java to work in
        the editor.

        <i>C. Make a Java project</i>
    </b>
    <p>
        Making a Java file isn't as simple as Python. When you make a Java file, you actually
        need to make a
        <i>project</i>, which contains packages and source files to run your Java code.
        It's complicated to explain, but thankfully you don't need to worry about
        it for the most part. Just follow the steps shown below.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open JCreator by double-clicking the icon on your desktop or opening your
            app list in the Start menu and clicking on the JCreator icon.</li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Once the window opens, disable and/or close the tips window that pops up (not important)
                and navigate to:
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>File >> New >> Project...</b>
                <br>
                <br>Additionally, you can just hit
                <b>Ctrl + Shift + N</b> to open a new project.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Select "Basic Java Application" as your project template and hit Next.
            <br>
            <img src="Images/jcreator/makeproj1.png" alt="Image not available :(" title="Select Basic Java Application."
                style="width:469px;height:357px;" hspace="10" vspace="10">
        </li>
        <li>
            Name your project and save it to a directory.
            <b>Do not use spaces or any special symbols or characters. Letters and underscores
                only.
            </b> Afterwards, hit Finish, then Finish again when the loading is done.
            <br>

                style="width:469px;height:357px;" hspace="10" vspace="10">
        </li>
    </ol>
    <b>
        <i>D. Run a Java project</i>
    </b>
    <p>
        When you finish making your project, your should have a new editor open, with a template
        waiting for you :). You can study the code for a bit, but you're going to
        want to run it.
        <br>
        <br>It's much easier than you think. Just
        <b>click the Run button at the top of the window</b> and see the code run. Additionally,
        you can just hit
        <b>F5</b>. The output is at the bottom of the editor, in the General Output
        window.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        By the end of this tutorial, you install Java and are able to run Java code in an
        editor. This is the part where you go and do some more work in Java to prepare
        for next year. Make this CS year great. Take some courses online, watch some
        quick videos, and above all else, write your own code, develop your own style
        and solve some problems.
