    <h1>Complete Java Install/Run Guide + Editor Choices</h1>
    <h6>By Syed Safwaan, Minister of Pythonic Affairs 2017-2018</h6>

    <p>
        In this guide, we'll be comprehensively going over how to install
        <b>Java and an editor (multiple options shown).</b>
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Introduction
        <small>
            <i>(skip at your own peril)</i>
        </small>
    </h2>

    <h3>Brief Overview of Language</h3>
    <p>
        Java is a high-level compiled, object-oriented (OOP) language. It's very popular
        in the field of software development and is a commonly used language in applications
        ranging from games to business tools. For a beginner, Java may be intimidating
        to deal with. However, with time and use, it quickly becomes natural and
        perhaps a favourite language as well, once its merits are realized.
    </p>

    <h3>Differences from Python</h3>
    <p>
        As stated above, Java is a
        <i>compiled language</i>. This is very different from Python, which is an
        <i>interpreted language</i>.
        <i>Interpreted</i> means that a program on your computer goes through your code
        <b>line-by-line</b> and executes each on the computer. It's a friendlier type
        of language, evident by the existence of Python Shell and IDLE, where you
        can both run code line by line (shell) and save programs (IDLE).
        <br>
        <br> However,
        <i>compiled</i> means that
        <b>at startup</b>, all the code is compressed into a readable format when you
        hit "run." Then, the code is all executed "at once," resulting in very fast
        programs. However, because of its compiled nature, there is no Java Shell
        (until
        <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/jshell/introduction-jshell.htm">Java 9</a>, that is). Java doesn't come with an IDLE either; it only has
        the libraries and the compiler when installed. This makes installing and
        running Java programs much more unintuitive for beginners coming from Python.
    </p>

    <h3>Purpose of This Guide</h3>
    <p>
        Installing Java is very different from installing Python. Sure, you can use
        <a target="_blank" href="https://repl.it/">repl.it</a> or some other online editor to write your code and avoid the
        hassles, but installing Java on your computer is certain to get you the best
        programming environment. With ICS4U approaching soon, it's imperative that
        we all get in some good Java XP before we enter, as Gr 12 CS is much more
        difficult than Gr 11, and best if not BSed :).
        <small>*cough*</small>
        <br>
        <br> With that out, I think it's safe to say that it's in all of your best interests
        to give Java at least a quick whirl before the school year.
    </p>

    <h3>Intended Audience</h3>
    <p>
        This guide is intended for
        <b>inexperienced users</b> who aren't sure how to configure Java correctly and
        would like some assistance. If you have more than rudimentary knowledge on
        how to install tools for a language and configure an editor, this guide will
        likely bore you.
        <br>
        <br> While this guide uses Windows 10 to demonstrate the procedure, a user of
        any OS can follow along and perform the same steps with minor modifications.
